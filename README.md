Task 7 – Browser Extension Security Audit
Introduction:

In this task, I explored how browser extensions can impact privacy and security. The goal was to manually check which extensions were installed in my browser, analyze if they were safe or suspicious, and remove the ones that might pose a risk. I used Google Chrome for this activity.

What I Did (Step-by-Step):

1. Opened the Extensions Page
I started by visiting chrome://extensions/ in my browser, which lists all currently installed extensions.

2. Reviewed Each Extension
I carefully looked at each extension and clicked on “Details” to check:

What permissions it requested:

1.Who the developer was

2.Whether I recognized it or not

3. Identified Suspicious Ones

Out of the 5 extensions installed, two caught my attention:

Free PDF Converter: I don’t remember installing this, and it had broad permissions like reading all browsing data.

Screen Recorder: I hadn’t used this in months, and it had access to screen recording, which is risky if left unused.

4. Removed the Unnecessary Ones
   
I decided to remove both of them:

 Free PDF Converter – Removed (unknown source and unnecessary access)

 Screen Recorder – Removed (not in use, requested sensitive permissions)

5. Restarted My Browser
After cleaning things up, I closed and reopened Chrome. I could immediately feel a slight improvement in speed, especially when opening new tabs.

 Extensions I Kept
Extension Name	Reason for Keeping
Grammarly:	I use it often for writing and it's from a trusted source
Dark Reader	:Helps with eye strain and is open-source
Adblock Plus:	Improves my browsing experience and is widely trusted

Key Takeaways:

Just because an extension is installed doesn’t mean it’s safe or needed.

Some extensions request more access than they really need, which can be dangerous.

Regular audits like this are simple but powerful for improving browser security.

Always install extensions only from official stores and reputable sources.

Conclusion
This task helped me understand the importance of checking browser extensions. I found and removed a few that I didn’t need or trust. Now, my browser feels faster and more secure. I’ll make sure to check my extensions regularly from now on.
